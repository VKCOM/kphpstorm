Reports missing @kphp-strict-types-enable comment above the strict_types=1 declaration in a PHP file. This inspection ensures that the necessary KPHP annotation is in place when strict typing is enabled.

<p>
    In KPHP, it's a best practice to annotate the strict typing feature with a @kphp-strict-types-enable comment. This provides clarity for developers, helping them understand that strict typing is actively enforced in the current file.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, a correct setup would look like:
</p>
<pre><code>
/** @kphp-strict-types-enable */
declare(strict_types=1);
</code></pre>

<!— tooltip end —>

<p>This inspection will highlight the <code>declare(strict_types=1)</code> directive if the corresponding KPHP comment is missing. A quick fix option will be provided to automatically insert the necessary comment.</p>
