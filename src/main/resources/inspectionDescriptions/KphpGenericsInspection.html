Various generics checks:
<li>Reports if the generic type is not within its bounds</li>
<li>Reports if the number of explicit generic types passed during instantiation does not match the expected count</li>
<li>Reports if more than one possible type has been deduced for the generic type</li>
<li>Reports if the generic type could not be deduced from known information (e.g. argument types, types when the class
    was created, etc.)
</li>
